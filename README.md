# Burger-Up! (updated using sequelize)

Burger-Up was created to showcase the use of Node to connect to a MySQL database and Express to handle the routing. Handlesbars was used  as a way to generate the HTML more quickly. The node package "sequelize" was utilized to more efficently write the ORM.

* Technology:
  * HTML 5
  * CSS
  * Javascript
  * Node.js
  * Express.js
  * Handlebars
  * MySQL
  * ORM (using sequelize)
  * MVC
  
* Functionality:
  1. Type in a burger that that you would like to eat in the left window and click submit. The burger name will display in the middle         window waiting to be "Devoured" by the user. 
  2. Click "Devour". Once the burger is eaten, it will update and save to the MySQL database to show that the burger has been consumed.

Enjoy your burger!
